    "# PyCity School Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based on the following data frames that have been created from the school district data, several conclusions regarding success in the form of test scores can be made. When first looking at the overall district summary, it is worth nothing that overall, students appear to test better in reading than in math. This is confirmed in the school summary data frame where across schools, the percentage of students passing reading is significantly higher than the percentage of students passing math. This is particularly true with district schools, whereas in most charter schools it appears that this difference in passing percentages of reading vs math is much smaller, but still leans in favor of higher passing percentages in reading.\n",
    "* This conclusion leads us into data frames identifying highest and lowest performing schools based on overall passing percentages. It is worth nothing that the five highest performing schools are charter schools with overall passing percentages of around 90% and the five lowest performing schools are district schools with passing percentages of around 58%. Further analysis will explore what factors may be responsible for the difference in performance across schools in the district.\n",
    "* The next data frames explore average scores by grade in each subject sorted by school. A quick scan of each will reveal that average scores are consistent across each grade and sit within 1-2 points of each other, suggesting that the discrepancy in scores is a factor of the schools as a whole. \n",
    "* The next data frame looks at school budget and spending per student. The summary table quickly shows an inverse trend related to spending ranges per student when examined against passing percentages, where schools with the highest spending ranges have the lowest passing percentages with a spending range of 645-680 dollars having a passing rate of 54% and schools with the lowest spending ranges have the highest passing percentages with <585 dollars having a passing rate of 90%. In most instances, more budget would be associated with increased improvement, however this is not the case here.\n",
    "* Finally, the last data frames organize the data based on school size and type. From the summary of school sizes, there is no significant difference in passing percentages between small to medium sized schools. However, schools in the large category seem to exhibit significantly lower passing percentages when compared to the former two sizes with a difference of 31-32%. Next, looking at the summary table based on school types, it appears that this is also a significant factor for passing test scores. Charter schools have a 90% overall passing rate, which is significantly higher than district schools which only have an overall passing rate of about 54%.\n",
    "* From this analysis it can therefore be concluded that larger schools and district schools struggle the most with attaining higher passing rates in standardized testing, while smaller schools and district schools test considerably better overall.\n",
