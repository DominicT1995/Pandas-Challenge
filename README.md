UTSA Data Analytics Bootcamp Pandas challenge where school district standardized test results will be aggregated and analyzed.

PYCITYSCHOOLS

The PyCitySchools folder contains the Resources folder which contains the schools_complete.csv file and the students_complete.csv file where the data for this analysis will be extracted from.

The PyCitySchools_Analysis.ipynb file in the PyCitySchools folder utilizes python code and the pandas library in a jupyter notebook in order to open and convert the schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv into dataframes. The python code will then perform calculations based on the data and aggregate the data into a variety of dataframes for analysis.

Dataframes used in this analysis include a district summary, a grouped school summary, highest and lowest performing schools by overall passing percentage, math and reading scores by grade grouped by schools, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.
